# CodeLLM

Welcome to **CodeLLM**! This repository contains various implementations and experiments based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The main focus is on preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of text-based models. It aims to provide insights and help you explore and understand NLP and machine learning techniques used in text processing.

## Implementations

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, case normalization, punctuation removal, and handling file encoding
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Counting and visualizing word frequency using custom methods and built-in tools.
- **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: A simple representation technique that converts text data into a matrix of word occurrences.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**: A more advanced text representation that calculates the importance of each word in a document relative to its frequency in the entire corpus.
- **RAG(Retrieval Augumented Generation)**:LangChain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Q&A System
- **Intellitube**: Intellitube (Youtube Video Analyzer) provides a clean Gradio interface to transcribe,summarize and interact with YouTube videos, all locally and efficiently, using Ollama.
