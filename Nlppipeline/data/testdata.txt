"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Some key techniques in NLP include tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, named entity recognition, and parts-of-speech tagging. NLP is widely used in applications like machine translation, chatbots, and text summarization."
