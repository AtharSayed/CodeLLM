# Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction (BoW and TF-IDF)

This project demonstrates the process of text preprocessing and feature extraction using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The code processes text data from an input file, cleans it, tokenizes it, and generates both BoW and TF-IDF representations of the text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `nltk`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `string`
  - `re`
  - `collections`

To install the required libraries, you can use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn
