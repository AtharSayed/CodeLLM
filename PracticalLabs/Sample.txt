Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines linguistics and computer science to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Some common applications of NLP include sentiment analysis, language translation, and text summarization. With the rapid growth of data on the internet, NLP has become increasingly important for businesses and researchers who need to extract useful insights from text-based information.
