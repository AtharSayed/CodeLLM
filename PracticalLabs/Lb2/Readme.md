# Text Processing with Tokenization, Stemming, and POS Tagging

This repository contains a Python script for performing text processing tasks using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as **Tokenization**, **Stemming**, and **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**. The script processes a given text file and outputs the tokenized text, stemmed tokens, and POS tags for each word in the text.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit): A powerful library for NLP tasks.
  
  You can install NLTK using pip:

  ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
