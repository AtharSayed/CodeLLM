# Text Processing with Tokenization, Stemming, and POS Tagging

This repository contains a Python script for performing text processing tasks using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as **Tokenization**, **Stemming**, and **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**. The script processes a given text file and outputs the tokenized text, stemmed tokens, and POS tags for each word in the text.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install all dependencies at once using the `requirements.txt` file.

### 1. Install Dependencies

To install the required libraries, simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
