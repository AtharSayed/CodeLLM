# General Knowledge

1. **Definition of Artificial Intelligence**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These machines are designed to perform tasks such as problem-solving, speech recognition, decision-making, and visual perception.

2. **Basic Concepts of Machine Learning**  
Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows machines to improve their performance through experience. There are different types of machine learning:
   - **Supervised Learning**: The machine is trained using labeled data.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: The machine tries to find hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: The machine learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

3. **Historical Development of Computing**  
Computing has evolved over centuries, from early tools like the abacus to modern-day supercomputers. Notable milestones include:
   - **The Turing Machine (1936)**: Introduced by Alan Turing, it is a conceptual device used to formalize the concept of computation.
   - **First Computers (1940s)**: Machines like ENIAC and UNIVAC were among the first to handle general-purpose computing tasks.

### Industry-Specific Knowledge

4. **The Role of Data in Business Intelligence**  
Data-driven decisions are fundamental to modern businesses. Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the technologies, applications, and practices for collecting, analyzing, and presenting business information. With the growth of big data, companies leverage BI tools to improve their decision-making processes.

5. **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**  
Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems and networks from digital attacks, theft, or damage. Key areas of focus include:
   - **Network Security**: Protecting the integrity of networks and their data.
   - **Application Security**: Ensuring software and applications are secure from threats.
   - **Incident Response**: The strategy used to respond to security breaches and mitigate their impact.

### Scientific Knowledge

6. **Laws of Thermodynamics**  
   - **First Law (Conservation of Energy)**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.
   - **Second Law**: The entropy (disorder) of an isolated system always increases over time.
   - **Third Law**: As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy approaches a constant minimum.

7. **Theory of Relativity**  
Albert Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity consists of two parts:
   - **Special Relativity**: Addresses the behavior of objects at high speeds and the relationship between space and time.
   - **General Relativity**: Expands upon special relativity by describing the effect of gravity as the curvature of space-time.

### Technical Documentation

8. **Python Programming Basics**  
   - **Variables and Data Types**: Python supports multiple data types, including integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries.
   - **Control Structures**: Python uses if-else conditions, loops (for, while), and functions to control the flow of execution.
   - **Libraries**: Popular libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` provide powerful tools for data manipulation and visualization.

9. **Web Development Overview**  
   Web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. It can be divided into:
   - **Frontend Development**: Deals with the user interface and experience (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
   - **Backend Development**: Manages the server, databases, and application logic (e.g., Node.js, Python Django).
   - **Full Stack Development**: Combines both frontend and backend technologies.
